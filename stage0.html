		<h2>Preliminary remarks about learning how to code</h2>
		<div>
			<p>When learning a new skill, thus going from novice to expert, you will go through several stages:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>ignorance</li>
				<li>awareness</li>
				<li>ability</li>
				<li>fluency</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Getting from ignorance to awareness and ability takes minutes and days. Getting from ability to fluency might take years.<br>
			Thus, it's important to have strategies to prevent frustration from turning into disappointment and demotivation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ask for help (Google, online forums,...)</li>
				<li>take a break</li>
				<li>just keep on going, accept a temporary lack of complete understanding</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>5 ways of thinking that programmers need</h2>
		<div>
			<ol>
				<li><em>procedural thinking:</em> Instructions that a computer can follow much faster than humans</li>
				<li><em>abstract thinking:</em> finding generality amongst seemingly different things</li>
				<li>
					<em>systematic debugging:</em>
					<ol>
						<li>Collect evidence</li>
						<li>generate theories</li>
						<li>test those theories</li>
						<li>fix problem</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li><em>technological empathy:</em> Ability to understand how computers work. Computers are machines.<br>
				But they cannot deal with ambiguous, context-related info ( at least not yet)</li>
				<li><em>systems thinking:</em> Break down a big problem into smaller pieces</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>The World Wide Web</h3>

					<li>it consists of servers that contain <b>HTML</b> documents</li>
					<li>you can access and display these files by using a program called <b>browser</b></li>
					<li><b>Hyperlinks</b> connect to other documents</li>
					<li>the main protocol of the web is called <b>http</b> and is used by servers to communicate with each other an with your browser</li>
